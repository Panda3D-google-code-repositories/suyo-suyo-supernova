# suyo-suyo-supernova
Space/Star mmorpg game involving the Suyo using panda 3d.
n Suyo-Suyo Supernova, you play as a "Suyo", which are short-little-chubby guys. You can choose the color of the suyos clothes, and collect garments (jewels, bells, etc) for his little hat to grow more powerful. The NPCs are these things called "Squidlings". Good squidlings grow up to turn into Galaxies, but evil Squidlings grow up to become Red Giants or Black Holes. The "Suyo" must protect the Galaxies from the evil Squidlings before they take over the good Squidlings.
